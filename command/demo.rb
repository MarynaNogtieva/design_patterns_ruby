# https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/command
# Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.
#  This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.

# In the Exercises project, look at the command/VideoEditor class.
#  This class represents the operations we can perform on a video,
#  such as adding a label to it or changing its contrast. 
# We need to allow the user to undo any changes he/she makes to a video.
